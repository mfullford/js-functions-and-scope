  2. Write a Javascript function called `transmogrifier`
  This function should accept three arguments, which you can assume will be numbers.
  The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product of the first two numbers,
  raised to the power of the third number.
  Your function should return the "transmogrified" result.

  3. Write a function `wordReverse` that accepts a single argument, a string. The method should return a string with the order of the words (not letters) reversed. Don't worry
  about punctuation. I.e. "hello world" should become "world hello".
